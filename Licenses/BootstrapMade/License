All templates listed at BootstrapMade.com are available for free download. We also offer paid/pro versions with more options and features. You can use the free versions in your personal or commercial projects as long as you comply with our license. It is also a good option to test, check the code and find out which template will work best for you. You can upgrade to the pro version later without losing your customization.

At BootstrapMade, we strive to provide high-quality website templates that cater to various needs and projects. Our licensing options are designed to offer flexibility and support for different usage scenarios, from personal projects to commercial ventures.

Developer Seats and Licensing

If you need more than five licenses, please contact us directly to discuss your requirements and to explore potential bulk purchasing options. We are happy to provide customized solutions to meet your team's needs.

By adhering to this policy, we ensure that each developer using our templates and Template Builder is properly licensed, which helps us continue to provide high-quality products and support to our customers.

Reselling and Redistribution
None of the licenses allow for the reselling or mass redistribution of the templates or projects built with our Template Builder. Creating a website for a client does not constitute redistribution and is permitted under the Pro and Premium Plan licenses.

It is not allowed to use the templates or projects built with our Template Builder, in whole or in part, in online SaaS website builders or to create themes for CMSs like WordPress and mass redistribute them, whether publicly or for a fee.

You are allowed to integrate a template or projects built with our Template Builder into a custom CMS or popular CMS like WordPress and use it yourself or for your clients, as long as it is not redistributed. This means you can create custom websites for clients using the templates or projects built with our Template Builder, but you cannot sell the templates as standalone products or use them to create themes for mass distribution.
